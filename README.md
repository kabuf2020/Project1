Plan so far:
1) to use iDigBio API and write a script that when given a genus name (we'll start with Lythrypnus)
   https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/IDigBio_API
2) to create and call a function that queries the API to search for collections of taxa from a particular genus included some related fields and to create a dataframe. 
3) to create and call a second function that will query the produced dataframe to generate a pie chart of the frequencies of species collected within the genus
4) to create and call a third function that will....
  
We had two starting points which is a bit confusing. The fully functional code is in the CallAPIFunction file. We intend to delete the other.

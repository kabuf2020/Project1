# Project1
Kyla Boyd, Christine Gross, Colette St. Mary

Plan so far:
to use iDigBio API and write a script that when given a genus name (we'll start with Lythrypnus)
   https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/IDigBio_API
will call a function that creates a dictionary of the species within the genus
a second function to query how many species in the genus have images available
and a third function to generate tuples consisting of collections (lots) and their size (number of specimens in the collection) for a species 
  and to plot those as a histogram.
